Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far we have created the bot and have taken input from the user in the correct format which will allow us to go into
a data base to correspond how many covid cases and other numbers related to that specific date there were. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We still have to code the part that goes into the data base and returns the covid numbes which we then can print

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We have not encountered any problems as of yet. I'm sure we will when trying to code the next part. We plan on
using similar technique like professor rosen showed us in class, using the social securtiy in class lecture.
