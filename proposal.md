# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

COVINFO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

a bot that will allow you to input a date and return how many covid cases there were on this specific date along
with other important information


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

As covid numbers are decreasing manyh of us are forgetting how deadly covid was and still is. And how it can still effect our lives. We want to create a bot that takes in user input and asks it for a specific date from the start 
of covid date to 2022(hopefully) and any date the the users puts in, the bot would output how many covid cases there were on that specific date. It will defintely remind all of us of how we all went throught this pandemic 
and the cracy numbers that were apparent that I think many have forgotten as masks are not mandated anymore. We plan on using a resourseful site such as New York Times to get our info which would 
tell us on which day, the number of covid cases. From there we plan on doing some research on how to create a bot as we already know that these dates and the number of covid cases would go into a dictonary. 
However, it would be a lot to put on the dictornary, so we want to find a more efficient route which we have to research on. But hopefully after that, we plan on executing a bot through either discord bot or 
creating a bot on Python. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Creating a bot that outputs the Covid cases for atleast some days in America

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Before the final project's deadline, my partner and I hope to acomplish creating a bot which would take in users input and aks for a specific date that they would like to see how many covid cases were on that date in America

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The Best outcome would be creating a bot that output the number of covid cases on a specific date not only for America, but for other countries as well. That would be ideal.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next steps is looking at useful sites such as New York Times, etc to get info about how many covid cases were on a spcecific date so we could use correct info to create our dictionary. One person plans to do that 
While the other person will look into the creation of the bot either through discord bot and/or through Python. We plan to start coding by this weekend.
